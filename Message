Here's a guide to fix the "not found" bug on MiniBridge:

1. Open the Files app on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Navigate to "On My iPhone/iPad."
3. Create a folder named "MiniBridge" and another named "MiniKey" if they don't exist already.
4. Ensure that the MiniKey text file is empty, with no text in it.
5. Once you've done this, try running MiniBridge again. This should resolve the "not found" issue.
